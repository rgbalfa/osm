#OSM Location

The goal of this exercise is to display a map at a custom path on a Drupal 8 site.  Please do not spend more than a couple hours on this exercise.

In a Docker container:
1. Create a Drupal 8 site
  * Create a content type that accepts a title, description, and latitude / longitude points
  * Display a map using OpenStreetMap at the path /map/osm
  * On the map, display a marker for each content item entered that has both a latitude and longitude
  * Create a README explaining how to set up the project
